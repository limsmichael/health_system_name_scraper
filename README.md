# Doctor Name Scraper
## Goal:
Job proposal asked for a developer to compile a list of doctors from Forrest Hospital in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  They also requested the doctor's office address/affiliation.

## Output:
This script scrapes all the doctors names and profile IDs from the hospital site and stores them in a Pandas dataframe.  I did not complete the remainder of the project because I didn't win the contract :)
